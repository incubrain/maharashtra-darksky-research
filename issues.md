- [ ] it seems that no diagnostics were saved when running
- [ ] we need a base level test suite to identify if everything is working as expected
  - maybe there are some online benchmarks we can use?
- [ ] ideally we would be saving the outputs into a 'run specific' dir along with the config settings, maybe use a timestamp for the dir name?
- [ ] Udmal is in the wrong location on the map
- [ ] extract `## Repository Structure` and other data like this from the `README.md` into an `AGENTS.md` file - this is where this information belongs
- [ ] check the sites against our ACTUAL pilot sites
- [ ] seperate the 'populous' cities into different config and increase the number to 11 to match our pilot site numbers
- [ ] there are too many output files, we need to consolodate where we can


## Nice to have

- [ ] create a bash script to do all setup and run pipeline; the goal should be one cmd to initialise everything - this may need flags for different options
- [ ] sub-district level analysis - probably decide this for a few districts strategically based on where we will likely be conducting our work
- [ ] most of the charts seem pretty useless to me, we need to think of better ways to store the data
